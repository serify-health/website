		<h2>About Serify</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Which clinics does Serify work with?</h3>
		Serify works with most clinics in the United States. If you would like to check whether a clinic is supported by our service or if you would like to use our service with a clinic outside the United States, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@serify.org">info@serify.org</a>.
		<br><br>
		<h3>How much does it cost to be Serified?</h3>
		Your first set of verifications will always be free. All subsequent verifications are also free for our beta users.
		<br><br>
		<h3>What happens if one or more of my STD test results is positive?</h3>
		Serify only requests and verifies negative STD test results. Unverified and positive test results will not appear on your public profile and will automatically be flagged for your review.
		<br><br>
		<h3>I saw a user with a Serify negative STD status. Does this mean that the user does not have that STD?</h3>
		No. Serify is a service that verifies medical information on file at reputable STD testing clinics. We do not assess whether this information  is accurate or not. In addition, there is a possibility that a user with an STD may nonetheless test negative, or a user may contract an STD subsequent to a negative test. Please refer to the <a ng-click="TermsButtonClick()">Terms of Use</a> for additional information.

		<br><br>
		<h3>What information do you collect?</h3>
		We strive to collect the minimum amount of information possible. To verify your health information, we require your first name, last name, date of birth, clinic, and signature. You must also provide the specific negative test results with dates that you want verified. Please note that in order to protect your privacy, we do not collect or verify positive test results.
		<br><br>
		<h3>Are you HIPAA-compliant?</h3>
		No, Serify is not a Covered Entity under HIPAA and therefore not responsible for complying with this federal regulation. That’s a good thing—we can help you share on your public profile the information that you want shared. Information that you choose not to share, for instance, your first name, last name, date of birth, clinic, and/or signature, will be stored securely according to industry standards for sensitive personal information.
